        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Plastic pollution is a growing environmental challenge, with <strong>polyethylene terephthalate (PET)</strong> making up nearly 10% of all plastic waste. <strong>PETase</strong>, an enzyme from <em>Ideonella sakaiensis</em>, has the potential to break down PET into its building blocks, enabling efficient recycling. However, its natural form is not optimized for industrial applications. My research focuses on <strong>leveraging machine learning to redesign PETase</strong>, enhancing its stability and catalytic efficiency for real-world use.</p>

        <h2>Machine Learning and Computational Methods</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>ProteinMPNN</strong>: A deep learning model trained for <strong>sequence design</strong>, used to generate optimized PETase variants.</li>
            <li><strong>HMM-based Sequence Search (HHblits)</strong>: Employed for <strong>iterative sequence searching</strong>, helping refine candidate enzyme sequences.</li>
            <li><strong>AlphaFold</strong>: Used for <strong>structure prediction</strong>, evaluating the folding stability and structural integrity of redesigned sequences.</li>
            <li><strong>TemStaPro & ProteinSol</strong>: Applied to assess the <strong>thermostability and solubility</strong> of modified PETase variants.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Results and Impact</h2>
        <p>By combining these computational techniques, we generated <strong>high-confidence enzyme designs</strong> that exhibit improved structural properties. The next step is to experimentally validate these optimized PETase variants using <strong>yeast surface display</strong> and functional assays. Ultimately, this work demonstrates how <strong>machine learning can accelerate enzyme engineering</strong>, offering innovative solutions for plastic degradation and sustainability.</p>

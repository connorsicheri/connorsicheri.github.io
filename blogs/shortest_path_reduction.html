        <h2>Problem 1</h2>
        <p>
            In this problem, you are given as input a directed graph G = (V, E), where each directed edge e ∈ E has a real-valued weight w(e),
            and a color c(e) ∈ {W, G, R} (for white, green, and red). A <strong>Bulgarian path</strong> in G is a path that alternates edges
            with colors W, G, and R, in this order.
        </p>
        <p>
            Assume that G has no negative weight Bulgarian cycle, i.e., there is no Bulgarian path in G whose first and last vertex are the same,
            and the sum of the edge weights along the path is negative.
        </p>
        <p>
            We define δ<sub>BG</sub>(s, u) to be the smallest weight of a Bulgarian path from s to u. The goal in this question is to compute
            the smallest weight Bulgarian paths from a given source vertex s to every other vertex in V.

        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>
            We transform our graph as follows:
        </p>
        <div class="image-gallery">
            <img src="original_graph.png" alt="Original Graph">
            <img src="transformed_graph.png" alt="Transformed Graph">
        </div>
        <p>
            For every node in G, in G' we replace it with three nodes (Red, Green, White). Every red edge in G is transformed to an edge (red → white),
            every white edge is transformed to (white → green), and every green edge is transformed to (green → red).
        </p>
        <h3>Theorem</h3>
        <p>
            Every path starting at a white node in G' is a Bulgarian path in G, and every Bulgarian path in G is represented as a path in G'
            starting with a white node.
        </p>
        <h3>Proof</h3>
        <p>
            The edge mapping function is bijective, meaning each edge in G has a corresponding edge in G' and vice versa. We define a color function
            c(k) based on the index modulo 3. Given a Bulgarian path p in G, we construct a path p' in G' such that it follows the Bulgarian path structure.
            Since edges in G' are mapped systematically, any path starting at a white node in G' will follow the same alternating pattern as a Bulgarian path.
        </p>
        <h3>Algorithm</h3>
        <p>
            To find the minimal Bulgarian path from u to v, we run the Bellman-Ford algorithm on G' starting from u<sub>white</sub>.
            Since we assumed there are no negative weight Bulgarian cycles in G, there are no negative weight cycles in G'.
            Then, we select the minimum distance to v<sub>white</sub>, v<sub>green</sub>, or v<sub>red</sub>.
        </p>
        <h3>Time Complexity</h3>
        <p>
            The time complexity is the same as running Bellman-Ford on G', which has 3n nodes and m edges. Thus, the running time is O(nm).

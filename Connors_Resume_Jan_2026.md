# EXPERIENCE

**Software Engineer (Backend Systems)** | May 2025 - Present  
**League Inc.** | Toronto, ON
- Scaffolded and launched the TELUS embedded client application, supporting 6,600+ activated users and over 1M contracted users on the platform.
- Led end-to-end onboarding of new tenants (Auth, cloud infrastructure, SDK configurations, API specs)
- Extended authentication logic to allow tenant-specific selection of JWT claim fields as the canonical user identifier.
- Worked directly with cloud infrastructure (AWS/GCP, containerized services, CI pipelines) to deploy, validate, and debug backend services across environments.

**Machine Learning Research Intern** | May 2024 - Sept. 2024  
**The Hospital for Sick Children - Lab of Dr. Mike Tyers** | Toronto, ON
- Awarded Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program scholarship.
- Designed and optimized a protein design pipeline using RF Diffusion, ProteinMPNN, and AlphaFold2.
- Instrumented high-performance computing workflows to enhance reliability and, through targeted optimization analysis, decreased centralized inference pipeline runtime by 80% on shared compute infrastructure.
- Implemented automated structural scoring and clustering to evaluate large candidate protein sets at scale.

**Bioinformatics Research Intern** | May 2023 - Sept. 2023  
**Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute - Lab of Dr. Anne-Claude Gingras** | Toronto, ON
- Applied ML methods to mass spectrometry (BioID) datasets to identify high-confidence protein interactions.
- Developed clustering workflows to remove contaminants and improve reproducibility in proteomics pipelines.

# PROJECTS

**User-Level Preemptive Threading Library (C, OS)** | Sept. 2024 - Nov. 2024
- Implemented a user-level threading system with preemptive round-robin scheduling.
- Built spin locks ensuring atomic access to shared data under concurrent execution.
- Designed a multi-level feedback queue scheduler for future performance scaling.

**Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) Renderer (Python, PyTorch)** | Oct. 2025 - Dec. 2025
- Implemented a complete NeRF pipeline for 3D scene reconstruction and novel-view synthesis.
- Developed ray generation using camera intrinsics/extrinsics and stratified sampling with positional encoding.
- Trained an MLP predicting RGB and density using differentiable volume rendering, producing photorealistic views and depth maps.

**Protein Sequence Redesign Pipeline (Python, HPC)** | June 2024 - Aug. 2024
- Automated structure-guided sequence redesign using HHblits, ProteinMPNN, and AlphaFold2.
- Optimized AlphaFold2 batching and caching for high-throughput runs on HPC clusters.
- Applied the pipeline to redesign a plastic-degrading enzyme, producing variants with predicted improvements in thermostability and solubility relevant to industrial recycling contexts.
